# Transform Array In-Place

**Difficulty:** Medium

Given an integer array**arr[]** of size **n**, where each element lies in the range [0, n-1], transform the array such that every element at index **i** becomes:
**arr[i]=arr[arr[i]].**

The transformation must be performed in-place, meaning the same array should store both the original and updated values without using another array.

**Examples:**

```
Input: arr[] = [1, 0]
Output: [0, 1]
Explanation: The original array is [1, 0]. At index 0, arr[0] = 1, so the new value becomes arr[1] = 0. At index 1, arr[1] = 0, so the new value becomes arr[0] = 1. Thus, the transformed array becomes [0, 1].
```

```
Input: arr[] = [4, 0, 2, 1, 3]
Output: [3, 4, 2, 0, 1]
Explanation: The original array is [4, 0, 2, 1, 3]. Each element is replaced by the value at index arr[i] in the original array. So the new values become 3, 4, 2, 0, 1 respectively, and the transformed array becomes [3, 4, 2, 0, 1].
```

**Constraints:**
1 ≤ n ≤ 4*10^4
0 ≤ arr[i] < n
